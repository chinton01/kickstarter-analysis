# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The purpose of this project is to perform various analysis for Louise's theater funding of her play, Fever. Louise would like to find out the amount of funds needed for her kickstarter, the best time to launch a kickstarter, and which genre to label her show. The analysis uncovers the following:
# Analysis

There were many important steps taken to get an accurate conclusion for Louise's kickstarter. The first step was to look into the average funding for a kickstarter and compared this to Louise's initial goal for funding. Louise's goal of funding is $10,000 which is 2x the average successful Kickstarter goal. [data-1-1-3-Starterbook](path/to/DestriptiveStatistics.xlxs) Comparing Louise's prefered budget goal to both the U.S and G.B. average successful campaign indicated the goal needed to be less than 4,000 GBP/5,400USD.
## Successful United States Category
The next step was to find which genres were successfull in the United States in order to narrow down the categories that would best fit her play. Filtering in Excel was used to break down the set location as well as the subcategory. This helped to pinpoint the specific category that did well in the U.S. To visualize this data, a pivot table and a bar chart was created. The most successful category in the U.S is Theater with roughly 525 successful kickstarter campaigns.![Parent Category Outcomes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90741799/134752215-db073a49-d21a-4852-ac49-1a67730415d6.png) Now that we know the most successful category, let's look into Great Britain's most successful category to compare.
## Successful Great Britain Category
A second chart created to compare and contrast the findings for Louise's due to some of her favorited theater productions being located in G.B. She might also kickstart a play there and would like to know which category does better. There are a total of 604 kickstarter campagns and the most successful category in Great Britain is Plays. ![GB Plays chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90741799/134752184-abce2a8f-f093-4d9b-a3b7-00c96c84c561.png)

# Results:

Throughout the findings within this analysis it is clear that Louise should lower her goal inorder to have successful funding for her upcoming play. While comparing her favorite plays in Great Britain as well as the United States, the findings point that her budget funding should be between $4,000-$5,000. The best time for Louise to start her campaign should be between the months of May and June. Depending the country, Louise should categoize her play in "Theater" if she decides to launch in the U.S or "Play" if she decides to launch in Great Britain.
