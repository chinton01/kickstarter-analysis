-Comparing Louise's prefered budget goal to both the U.S and G.B. average successful campaign indicated the goal needed to be less than 4,000 GBP/5,400USD.

# Recommendations:

Throughout the findings within this analysis it is clear that Louise should lower her goal inorder to have successful funding for her upcoming play. While comparing her favorite plays in Great Britain as well as the United States, the findings point that her budget funding should be between $4,000-$5,000. The best time for Louise to start her campaign should be between the months of May and June. Depending the country, Louise should categoize her play in "Theater" if she decides to launch in the U.S or "Play" if she decides to launch in Great Britain.
